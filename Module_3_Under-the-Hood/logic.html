    <h1>Logic Gates</h1>
    <p>Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital systems.</p>
    <h2>Types of Logic Gates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>AND Gate: Outputs true if both inputs are true.</li>
        <li>OR Gate: Outputs true if at least one input is true.</li>
        <li>NOT Gate: Outputs the inverse of the input.</li>
        <li>NAND Gate: Outputs false only if both inputs are true.</li>
        <li>NOR Gate: Outputs true only if both inputs are false.</li>
        <li>XOR Gate: Outputs true if only one input is true.</li>
        <li>XNOR Gate: Outputs true if both inputs are the same.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How Logic Gates Work</h2>
    <p>Logic gates take one or more binary inputs (0s and 1s) and produce a single binary output based on the type of gate and the logical operation it performs.</p>
