    <h1>Memory</h1>
    <p>Memory is a crucial component of a computer system that stores data and instructions for the CPU to process.</p>
    <h2>Types of Memory</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary storage that is fast and volatile.</li>
        <li>ROM (Read-Only Memory): Permanent storage that is non-volatile and used to store firmware.</li>
        <li>Cache Memory: A small amount of high-speed memory located inside the CPU for quick access to frequently used data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How Memory Works</h2>
    <p>Memory works by storing data in binary form (0s and 1s) and allowing the CPU to read and write data as needed.</p>
